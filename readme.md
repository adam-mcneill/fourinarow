A two-player command line version of Four in a Row (Connect Four)

A game for two players. The players take turns dropping counters into a 7x6 grid. Whoever lines up four of their counters first, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally, wins.

Normally this game uses physical counters of two different colours but since this is a command-line program they counters are represented by 'O' and 'X'.

A number from 1 to 7 can be entered as a command to drop a counter into the corresponding column, providing it isn't already full.

This is my solution to a practice project from chapter 14 of Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart
